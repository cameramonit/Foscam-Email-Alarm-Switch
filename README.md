Foscam-Email-Alarm-Switch
=========================

This is a basic script that lets someone with Foscam IP Cameras turn the email alarm on or off without having to
manually do it on each one.

It requires that the user know the Python programming language and is primarily made for a user with multiple Foscam IP
Cams, which have their own ports assigned.  The script itself is pretty basic though so anyone with Python knowledge
should be able to manipulate it to their ends.
